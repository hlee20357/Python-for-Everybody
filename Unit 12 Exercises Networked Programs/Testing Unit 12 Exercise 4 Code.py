#Exercise 4: 
# 
# Change the urllinks.py program to extract and count paragraph (p) tags from the retrieved HTML document and display the count of the paragraphs as the output of your program. 
# Do not displayvthe paragraph text, only count them. 
# Test your program on several small web pages as well as some larger web pages.

#Below is what urllinks.py looks like 

# To run this, download the BeautifulSoup zip file
# http://www.py4e.com/code3/bs4.zip
# and unzip it in the same directory as this file

import os 
#from pathlib import Path
print ('Get current working directory: ', os.getcwd())

print ('For current directory that the script is being run: ', os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

#In Python, you can use __file__ to get the path of the current file, i.e., the currently running script file (.py). 
# This is particularly useful when you need to read other files relative to the current file's location.
print('basename:    ', os.path.basename(__file__))
#Gives the python file name 
print('dirname:     ', os.path.dirname(__file__))
#Gives the path to which the python file is stored 

#Difference between absolute and relative paths
#Absolute paths give all the \ marks. Relative paths don't. 
#When you do __file__, the absolute path is given for Python 3.9 and above. 

#Note: If you want to read a file, you have to change your working directory to where the file is being stored. 
print('[change directory]')
os.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
print ('')
print('getcwd:      ', os.getcwd())
