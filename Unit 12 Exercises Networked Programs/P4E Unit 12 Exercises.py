#Chapter 12: Networked programs 

#Exercise 1: Change the socket program socket1.py to prompt the user for the URL so it can read any web page. 
#You can use split('/') to break the URL into its component parts so you can extract the host name for the socket connect call. 
#Add error checking using try and except to handle the condition where the user enters an improperly formatted or non-existent URL.

#Original socket1.py below. 

#import socket
#mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
#mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
#cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
#mysock.send(cmd)
#while True:
#    data = mysock.recv(512)
#    if len(data) < 1:
#        break
#    print(data.decode(),end='')
#mysock.close()

import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
user_response = input ('Enter a URL you want to read: ')
try: 
    user_response_for_splitting = user_response.split('/')
    main_website=user_response_for_splitting[2]
    mysock.connect((main_website, 80))
except: 
    print ('This did not work. Sorry!')
    exit()

cmd = 'GET '+ user_response+ ' HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'
mysock.send(cmd.encode())
while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    #At this stage, data that's encoded is of class bytes objects
    #print (data)
    #print ('space')
    if len(data) < 1:
        break
    #print ('  Y           ') used to determine what was happening 
    print(data.decode(),end = '')
    #Note: data.decode() can be saved as a variable 
    #data.decode() class type is a string. 

mysock.close()

#Note. There is a difference between print(data.decode(),end='') and print (data.decode())

#data.decode() leads to 
#...
#Who is already s
#ick and pale with grief
#[blank line]

#data.decode(),end='' leads to 
#...
#Who is already sick and pale with grief
#No blank line here 

#For print, you can have an optional end parameter. 
#It specifies what to print at the end, and the default is a new blank line. 

#Since the text that it is receiving is greater than 512 characters, the 512 characters will be printed and then after that 512th character, a new line will be formed. 
#This can be seen because a new line is formed after "Who is already s" The new line is formed, and the second time the print statement is reached, the printing begins on that new line. 
#That's why if you do end = '' with the print statement, a continuous text is printed because there was no new line to start printing from. 
#with end = '', the printing continues where it left off. 
#Although it seems like all 512 characters went through on the first try, it actually didn't happen. 

#Note: I was able to get http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt to be printed with the formated socket1.py with added try/except block and input statement. 

#Exercise 2: 
# 
# Change your socket program so that it counts the number of characters it has received and stops displaying any text after it has shown 3000 characters. 
# The program should retrieve the entire document and count the total number of characters and display the count of the number of characters at the end of the document.

#Exercise 3: 
# 
#Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of 
# (1) retrievingthe document from a URL, 
#(2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and
#(3) counting the overall number of characters in the document. 
# Donâ€™t worry about the headers for this exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.

    #Prompt says you have to display up to 3000 characters. 
    #Based off of the wording, you don't have to display EXACTLY 3000 characters. 
    #For example, if the count before the new line (B) is 2990, and B's length is 30, then any characters in B won't be displayed. 
        print (line, end = '')

print('Character count in the document: ', count)

#Exercise 4: 
# 
# Change the urllinks.py program to extract and count paragraph (p) tags from the retrieved HTML document and display the count of the paragraphs as the output of your program. 
# Do not displayvthe paragraph text, only count them. 
# Test your program on several small web pages as well as some larger web pages.

#Below is what urllinks.py looks like 

# To run this, download the BeautifulSoup zip file
# http://www.py4e.com/code3/bs4.zip
# and unzip it in the same directory as this file

#import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
#from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
#import ssl

# Ignore SSL certificate errors
#ctx = ssl.create_default_context()

# Remember that recv receives characters (newlines and all), not lines.
